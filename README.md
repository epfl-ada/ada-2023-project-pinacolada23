# The Evolution of Actors Post-Blockbuster in the Film Industry

## Abstract

This project aims to analyze the career trajectories of actors following their roles in high-grossing films, using the CMU Movie Dataset as a primary resource. We're curious about how a significant box office success impacts an actor's subsequent choices and overall career path. Specifically, we intend to explore two dimensions: the evolution in the types of roles these actors undertake post-blockbuster, and the continuity of their box office success. This study seeks to find out patterns and trends in the film industry, providing insights into how a commercial success influence an actor's career decisions. By examining these aspects, we hope to understand and share the story of how sucess works in movie business and how it affects actors over time.

## Research questions

- How does a major box office success influence the type of roles an actor is offered subsequently?
- Is there a noticeable change in the genre or type of characters portrayed by actors after a significant hit
- Does a high-grossing film consistently lead to continued box office success for its actors in their subsequent films?
- What are the long-term career impacts on actors who have starred in blockbuster hits?

## Proposed additional datasets(if any)

## Methods

- Data Integration and Cleaning: Merging datasets and ensuring consistency
- Statistical Analysis: To find correlations between box office success and changes in roles for example.
- Data visualization: For clear representation of trends and patterns.
- Machine Learning Techniques: Employing clustering algorithms to group actors based on similarities in their career paths post-hit.
- Time-Series Analysis: Identifying patterns and anomalies over time in box office performance and role selection.
